"The DB Monitor (DBM) is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that alerts you "
"via email anytime a change/modification occurs in your WordPress database or "
"a new database table is created in your WordPress database. The DB Monitor "
"email alert contains information about what database change/modification "
"occurred and other relevant help info. Your DB Monitor Log also logs any "
"changes/modifications to your WordPress database and other relevant help "
"info. The DBM IDS is similar to the ARQ IDPS where it is the most powerful "
"last line of website security protection defense. If all other outer and "
"inner layers of security protection are penetrated then the most powerful "
"DBM IDS and ARQ IDPS systems kick in and protect your website from attacks/"
"hackers. Even if these powerful security measures are never utilized the "
"most significant benefit is that you know for sure that neither your website "
"files or your WordPress database have been tampered with."
