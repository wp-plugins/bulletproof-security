The 403.php Security Logging file is where the check occurs whether or not to log or not log a User Agent/Bot. It would be foolish and costly to website performance to have your WordPress database handle the task/function/burden of checking which User Agents/Bots to log or not log. WordPress database queries are the most resource draining function of a WordPress website. The more database queries that are happening at the same time on your website the slower your website will perform and load.
