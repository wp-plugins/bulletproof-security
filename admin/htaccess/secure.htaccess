# BPS PRO ERROR LOGGING AND TRACKING - Available in BPS Pro only
# BPS Pro has premade 403 Forbidden, 400 Bad Request and 404 Not Found files that are used 
# to track and log 403, 400 and 404 errors that occur on your website. When a hacker attempts to
# hack your website the hackers IP address, Host name, Request Method, Referering link, the file name or
# requested resource, the user agent of the hacker and the query string used in the hack attempt are logged.
# BPS Pro Log files are added to the P-Security All Purpose File Manager to view them.
# All BPS Pro log files are htaccess protected so that only you can view them. 
# The 400.php, 403.php and 404.php files are located in /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/
# The 400 and 403 Error logging files are already set up and will automatically start logging errors
# after you install BPS Pro and have activated BulletProof Mode for your Root folder.
# If you would like to log 404 errors you will need to copy the logging code in the BPS Pro 404.php file
# to your Theme's 404.php template file. Simple instructions are included in the BPS Pro 404.php file.
# You can open the BPS Pro 404.php file using the WP Plugins Editor or by using the BPS Pro File Manager.
# NOTE: By default WordPress automatically looks in your Theme's folder for a 404.php template file.
