# BULLETPROOF .45.9 >>>>>>> DEFAULT .HTACCESS

# WARNING THE default.htaccess FILE DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR WEBSITE AGAINST HACKERS
# This is a standard generic htaccess file that does NOT provide any website security
# The DEFAULT .HTACCESS file should only be used for testing purposes
# If for some strange reason your host does not have +FollowSymlinks enabled by default at
# the root level then you will need to enable Options +FollowSymlinks for mod_rewrite to work.
# If you are getting HTTP Error 500 Internal server errors and you have checked to make sure
# everything else is set correctly then remove the # sign in front of Options +FollowSymlinks
# below. If you are still getting 500 errors then immediately put the # sign back. All hosts
# these days should have this enabled by default. Enabling this will actually cause 500 server
# errors if your host has this enabled so you should probably never have to remove the # sign. 
# Options +FollowSymlinks

# These are some common Apache Directives to force PHP5 to be used instead of PHP4
# Some web hosts have very specific directives - check with your web host first
# Remove the pound sign in front of AddType x-mapp-php5 .php for 1&1 web hosting
# AddType x-mapp-php5 .php
# Other common possibilities depending on your web host - check with your web host first
# AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php
# AddHandler cgi-php5 .php
