WordPress website security protection. BulletProof Security protects your website from XSS, CSRF, Base64 and SQL Injection hacking attempts. 

== Description ==

Website Security Protection: BulletProof Security protects your website from XSS, CSRF, Base64_encode and SQL Injection hacking attempts. One-click .htaccess WordPress security protection. Protects wp-config.php, bb-config.php, php.ini, php5.ini, install.php and readme.html with .htaccess security protection. One-click Website Maintenance Mode (HTTP 503). Additional website security checks: DB errors off, file and folder permissions check... System Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Memory Usage, IP, Max file sizes... Built-in .htaccess file editing, uploading and downloading.

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess
 website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
 WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
 BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
 folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess
 security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
 Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, CSRF,
  Base64_encode and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

Maintenance Mode is AutoMagic as of BulletProof Security .46.1. Create your website 
under maintenance page within BulletProof Security in minutes and activate Maintenance Mode to put your
 website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure. BulletProof Security provides the additional website
 security measures and protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin is a secure radio button form that allows you to 
add (activate) .htaccess files to your website without having to use FTP or your web host control panel. BulletProof Security
 .htaccess protection is a fast one click website security solution. BPS has built-in Backup and Restore, a File Editor, 
 a File Uploader and a File Downloader to make managing the BPS master .htaccess files and your website security fast and simple. 

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page
 for new fixes that are not yet included in the most current version of BPS. Typically a simple .htaccess skip rule is all 
 that is required to fix any plugin issues.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using WordPress Permalinks for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If you are not
using Permalinks then you will get a warning message the Permalinks need to be enabled when you access the BulletProof 
Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic .htaccess file creation so that only one click is required to automatically create your .htaccess security files. BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files
using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and 
Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work automatically for the most common WordPress installation, which is WordPress 
installed in the root website folder so there is no need to use the AutoMagic .htaccess file create buttons. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct .htaccess files for your website so if you're not sure what you have then use the AutoMagic create buttons. If your WordPress installation was in a subfolder then clicking the AutoMagic .htaccess file create buttons is essential or if you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your .htaccess using the built-in File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files. When in doubt just use AutoMagic and BPS will automatically add all the correct .htaccess information for you specific website. You can edit your .htaccess files at any time using the built-in file editor so you might
 just want to use AutoMagic to save time and then do any additional edits to the  .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess 
 file editor.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain
 .htaccess code that protects your website against XSS, CSRF, Base64_encode and SQL Injection. 
 Add any additional .htaccess code to the Master .htaccess files to either add additional website
 security protection or do many other things. You can do a lot of really neat stuff with .htaccess files
 besides just adding website security protection.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes. BulletProof Security has full AutoMagic capability and still offers full manual control 
of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in file editor. The BPS master .htaccess files have 
already been created for you. When you use the AutoMagic .htaccess file creation feature the .htaccess files
are written for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added 
to your .htaccess files. You can add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit 
 the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress 
 Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. 
 BPS could also just be used simply as an online .htaccess file manager. BulletProof Security is designed
  to be a real time online .htaccess file editor that each website owner has complete manual control over 
  instead of just an "auto-writing" approach. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual
  editing control makes BulletProof Security a great tool that offers the best website security protection
  that you can add to your WordPress website in my opinion.
