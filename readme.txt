WordPress website security protection. BulletProof Security protects your website from XSS, RFI, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. 

== Description ==

Website Security Protection: BulletProof Security protects your website from XSS, RFI, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. One-click .htaccess WordPress security protection. Protects wp-config.php, bb-config.php, php.ini, php5.ini, install.php and readme.html with .htaccess security protection. One-click Website Maintenance Mode (HTTP 503). Additional website security checks: DB errors off, file and folder permissions check... System Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Memory Usage, IP, Max file sizes... Built-in .htaccess file editing, uploading and downloading.

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess
 website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
 WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
 BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
 folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess
 security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
 Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, CSRF,
  Base64_encode and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

Maintenance Mode is AutoMagic as of BulletProof Security .46.1. Create your website 
under maintenance page within BulletProof Security in minutes and activate Maintenance Mode to put your
 website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure. BulletProof Security provides the additional website
 security measures and protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin is a secure radio button form that allows you to 
add (activate) .htaccess files to your website without having to use FTP or your web host control panel. BulletProof Security
 .htaccess protection is a fast one click website security solution. BPS has built-in Backup and Restore, a File Editor, 
 a File Uploader and a File Downloader to make managing the BPS master .htaccess files and your website security fast and simple. 

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page
 for new fixes that are not yet included in the most current version of BPS. Typically a simple .htaccess skip rule is all 
 that is required to fix any plugin issues.

= What is the difference between BulletProof Security free and BulletProof Security Pro? =

BulletProof Security free provides .htaccess protection against browser based hacking attempts: XSS, RFI, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. It is recommended that you additionally add a secure custom php.ini, log PHP errors, lock ALL WordPress Mission Critical files and add HTTP error logging for your website. BulletProof Security Pro contains the same secure .htaccess files as the free version and includes secure custom php.ini files, logs PHP errors, locks ALL WordPress Mission Critical files on the fly and has built-in HTTP error logging to log 400, 403 and 404 errors that occur on your website.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway).
 If you are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Permalinks need to be enabled when you
 access the BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one click is required to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every type of WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, Network / MU subdirectory websites and Network / MU subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master .htaccess files for your website when you use AutoMagic so if you're not sure what you have then use the AutoMagic create buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your .htaccess using the built-in File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files. When in doubt just use AutoMagic and BPS will automatically add all the correct .htaccess information for you specific website. You can edit your .htaccess files and add additional .htaccess code at any time using the built-in file editor.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain 
 .htaccess code that protects your website against XSS, RFI, CSRF, Base64_encode, Code Injection and SQL Injection. 
 Add any additional security filters or other .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. Within the BulletProof Security .htaccess files you will see additional options that you can choose as well. .htaccess files can do many other things besides just providing website security protection.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes. BulletProof Security has full AutoMagic capability and still offers full manual control 
of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. The BPS Master .htaccess files have already been created for you. When you use the AutoMagic .htaccess file creation buttons the .htaccess files
are written / created for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added 
to your .htaccess files. You can add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit 
 the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress 
 Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. 
 BPS could also just be used simply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. BulletProof Security is designed
  to be a real time online .htaccess file editor that each website owner has complete manual control over 
  instead of just an "auto-writing" approach. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual
  editing control makes BulletProof Security a versatile tool that offers a range of website security management options.
  
= Does BulletProof Security Work on Windows IIS Hosting? =

Yes and No. .htaccess files are only used on Linux based hosting. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS
hosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but you cannot Activate BulletProof Modes. At some point in the future  
additional coding will be added for Windows IIS websites.

= Is BulletProof Security Network / MU / Multisite Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network /  MU / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess code is written / created for your specific Network / MU site. BulletProof Modes should only be Activated on the Primary site. All sub sites are virtual and there is no need to Activate BulletProof Modes on sub sites. This will actually screw up your Primary site. BPS allows only Super Admins to see the BPS menus in sub sites.

= Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites? =

Yes. BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory".

What's New in .46.5
* BPS .46.5 is forbidding thumbnailer scripts by default. To allow thumbnailer scripts on your website see the root .htaccess file for instructions on allowing thumbnailer scripts on your website. If your Theme or any of your Plugins are using a Thumbnailer script such as TimThumb, phpThumb, Thumb or variations of these thumbnailer scripts then you should check (ask the author, creator or Google it) and make sure that you have a recently patched version of the thumbnailer script that you are using. A Zero Day Vulnerability exists in older versions of these thumbnailer scripts and your website might be vulnerable. Thumbnailer scripts are automatically seen by BPS as a threat, exploit or vulnerability because of the general nature of these scripts.
* Network / MU AutoMagic Buttons have been added. BPS detects what type of installation you have and tells you which AutoMagic buttons to use.
* Major Code Changes and Massive new .htaccess Security Filters - The root and other .htaccess files contains a massive amount of new security filters as well as other new .htaccess code.
* Lots of other stuff
