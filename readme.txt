Fast one click website security protection. Protects your website from ALL XSS and SQL Injection hacking attempts. 

== Description ==

Website Security Protection: Protects your website from ALL XSS & SQL Injection hacking attempts. Base64_encode code injection blocked. One-click .htaccess security file protection. Protects wp-config.php, php.ini and php5.ini with .htaccess security. One-click website under maintenance (HTTP 503). WP META Generator tag removed, WP version hidden, ensure WordPress DB errors are turned off, file and folder permissions check, system info display (PHP, MySQL, OS, Memory Usage, IP, Max file sizes, etc.). File editing, file uploading and file downloading from within the WP Dashboard.

The BulletProof Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and convenient one click method for you to
activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess website under maintenance modes from within
your WordPress Dashboard. The BulletProof Security WordPress plugin is a one click solution that simply copies,
renames and moves the provided .htaccess master files in the BulletProof Security plugin folder to either your root
folder or your /wp-admin folder or both from within your WordPress Dashboard.

There is no need to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to switch between
BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode(503 Website Under Maintenance), WordPress Default .htaccess Mode and
BulletProof Security .htaccess Mode. In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from
ALL XSS and SQL Injection hacking attacks. The maintenance .htaccess file allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure. BPS provides the additional website
 security measures and protection that every website should have. In addition, BPS provides php.ini and other 
 important website security and server information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin is a secure radio button form that allows you to 
add (activate) .htaccess files to your website without having to use FTP. BulletProof Security
 htaccess protection is one click website security. BPS has a built in File Editor, 
 File Uploader and File Downloader to make managing the BPS files and your website security fast and simple. 

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins? =

One possible conflict may exist with BuddyPress-Facebook Connect.
 Bug fixes completed as of BPS .45.5 for: Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu, ComicPress, 
Simple Facebook Connect and W3 Total Cache. If you know of a plugin that conflicts with 
BulletProof Security please notify AITpro.com.

= Are there any known conflicts with any WordPress Themes? =

No. But there is a known issue with WordPress Themes that are using TimThumb. A fix has been
 implemented as of BPS .45.6.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain
 .htaccess code that protects your website against ALL XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and SQL Injection
hacking attacks. Add your own additional .htaccess code to the master .htaccess
files to make them even more BulletProof to hackers.

= Does the BulletProof Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

No. The .htaccess files have already been created for you. You can add additional code
to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess 
master files if you want to. BPS could also be used simply as an .htaccess file manager as well.
BulletProof Security is designed to handle copying, renaming and moving of the master .htaccess files 
and of course making your website BulletProof to hackers. BPS does have File writing capability, 
but the file writing is designed to be real time file editing that the website owner has complete 
control over instead of an "auto-writing" approach.
