= Why is .htaccess Website Security So Much Better Than Any Other Type of Website Security? =

The answer is very simple - .htaccess files (distributed configuration files) are processed first before any other code on your website. In other words, 
hackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files before those scripts even have a chance to 
reach the php coding in WordPress. BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to 
Apache Linux Servers. Please read the FAQ page for Server compatibility questions. 

= BulletProof Security Fast and Simple with No Manual Configuration Required =

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess 
website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess 
security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, RFI, 
CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

= BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode =

BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode allows you to create your custom website under maintenance page within BulletProof Security 
and activate Maintenance Mode to put your website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website. Allow access to your WordPress Dashboard for only yourself or add additional IP 
addresses to allow mulitple IP addresses access to your WP Dashboard while in maintenance mode.

= BulletProof Security Additional Website Security Protection =

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
have additional website security measures in place as a standard. BulletProof Security provides that additional website
 security protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess Core work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to instantly create and activate .htaccess website security with 
one click (ok maybe a few clicks) for your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master 
.htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes .htaccess code that is customized for your website. There is nothing to figure out 
or to configure. Click the AutoMagic buttons (creates customized Master .htaccess files) and Activate BulletProof Modes (copies 
the customized Master .htaccess files to your root and wp-admin folders). BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and 
an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. BulletProof Website Security fast and simple. Enjoy!

= How does BulletProof Security Plugin Login Security & Monitoring work? =

BulletProof Security Login Security & Monitoring allows you to choose whether you want to Log All User Account Logins or 
Log Only User Account Lockouts. The Dynamic DB Logging Form has 3 checkbox options: Lock, Unlock or Delete database rows. 
The Login Security database table is hooked into the WordPress Users database table, but they are 2 completely separate 
database tables. If you lock a User Account then BPS Pro will enforce that lock on that User Account and the User will not 
be able to log in. If you unlock a User Account then the User will be able to login. Deleting database rows in the Login Security 
database table does NOT delete the User Account from the WordPress Users database table. When you delete a User Account it is 
pretty much the same thing as unlocking a User Account. To delete actual User Accounts you would go to the WordPress Users page 
and delete that User Account.

= What do I do if my User Account is locked out? =

A stand alone Login Security Unlock User Account Form has been created that allows you to Unlock locked User Accounts outside 
of your WordPress Dashboard. To use this stand alone script download it from this BulletProof Security Pro plugin 
folder - /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php and then upload it to your website root folder. 
Then type in the path to the bpsunlock.php file in your Browser. Example: http://www.example.com/bpsunlock.php. The stand alone 
script displays step by step instructions on how to use it.

= Do I need to understand .htaccess code in order to use the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess Core? =

No, The .htaccess file creation is automated in BulletProof Security. Everything is automatically done for you.
You do not need to know or understand anything about .htaccess website security files in order to use the 
BulletProof Security plugin. Extensive help information can be found in the Blue Read Me help buttons in BPS.

= What do I do if I cannot log back into my website due to an htaccess file problem? =

If you accidentally activated BulletProof Modes without first clicking the AutoMagic buttons or if you put your 
website in Maintenance Mode and your IP address has been changed by your ISP and you cannot log back into 
your website then you will need to use FTP or your Web Host Control Panel File Manager and delete the .htaccess file 
that BPS created in your website root folder. BPS website security is done purely with .htaccess website security
and nothing else is modified on your website. So simply deleting the .htaccess file in your website root folder
removes BPS website security and will allow you to log back in, use the AutoMagic buttons and activate 
BulletProof Mode again to protect your website again.

= Will BulletProof Security cause my website to run slower? =

No, BulletProof Security will not cause a website to run slower. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized 
and uses very little/low website resources and very little Server memory. If you would like to check your plugins to check 
how much website resource and Server memory each of your plugins is using install the P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler) plugin.
Both W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache use .htaccess code to speed up your website.

= BPS Alert! Your site does not appear to be protected by BulletProof Security. What does the Alert mean? =

When upgrading/updating the BulletProof Security plugin you may see this WP Dashboard Alert. <strong>BPS Alert! Your site does not 
appear to be protected by BulletProof Security.</strong> There are 2 very common issues/problems that can cause this. The cPanel 
HotLink Protection Tool issue or the WordPress flush_rewrite_rules function issue. Click this link <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/bps-setup-steps-removal-steps-requirements-and-compatibility/" title="BulletProof Security Forum">Common BPS Issues</a> 
Note: Any custom htaccess code or modifications that you have made to your htaccess files will not be altered, modified or changed 
during the auto-update. Activating BulletProof Modes again after upgrading BPS is no longer necessary.

= Where can I find BulletProof Security additional troubleshooting steps & support? =

Please see the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/forum/bulletproof-security-free/" title="BulletProof Security Forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BulletProof Security Forum.</a>

= BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty =

* Compatible with Apache CGI configured Servers
* Compatible with Apache DSO configured Servers (May require file/folder permission and/or Ownership changes)
* Compatible with Nginx frontend Server with Apache backend Server
* Compatible with LiteSpeed Servers
* Compatible with Windows IIS Servers - Windows Hosting - See IMPORTANT NOTES below.
* If your IIS Server has ISAPI_Rewrite installed then you CAN use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes.
* <strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong> If you have an IIS Server you may or may not be able to use .htaccess files and can only use Login Security & Monitoring. 
If your IIS Server is using the URL Rewrite Module then you can probably use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes. If you activate 
BulletProof Modes and your website crashes then FTP to your website and delete the root .htaccess file and the wp-admin .htaccess file. You 
will not be able to use .htaccess files on your Server/website and can only use Login Security and the other features in BPS.
 
= Additional BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty Info =

BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to Apache Linux Servers. BPS is compatible with Apache Linux Servers, 
LiteSpeed Servers, Nginx Servers (if the Nginx Server is the frontend Server and Apache Linux Server is the backend Server). If you do not know what type of Server 
you have you can check your Server Type and Operating System on the BPS System Info page. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS
hosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but may or may not be able to Activate BulletProof Modes depending on what your IIS Server does and 
does not have installed / configured. Please see this WordPress Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Permalinks_without_mod_rewrite" title="Permalinks without mod_rewrite" target="_blank">Permalinks without mod_rewrite</a> for additional information regarding IIS Servers and also the Helicon Tech website <a href="http://www.isapirewrite.com/" title="Helicon Tech ISAPI_Rewrite" target="_blank"> for additional information regarding ISAPI_Rewrite.

= Does BulletProof Security Work on ALL Nginx Servers / Server Configurations? =

If you are using both Apache and Nginx together and Nginx is the frontend webserver and Apache is the backend Server
used to process PHP then BulletProof Security will work on this type of combined Server Configuration. If you are only
using Nginx then an .htaccess file will not work. Nginx has its own rewrite module - HttpRewriteModule and the mod_rewrite equivalent
of an .htaccess file has similar, but different coding and is added to an Nginx Server config file.
Note: If you are not familiar with Nginx, then it should be noted that Nginx does not have a PHP module like Apache's mod_php, 
instead you either need to build PHP with FPM (ie: php-fpm/fastcgi), or you need to pass the request to something that can handle PHP.

= Are there any known issues or conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Occasionally issues or conflicts do occur with other plugins, but they are always quickly resolved. BPS is compatible with all
other Plugins and Themes. An .htaccess bypass / skip rule is all that is required to allow a plugin or theme to do something that is blocked by BPS.
Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page for the latest plugin bypass / skip rules. All new plugin skip / bypass 
rules are now being posted in the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/" title="BPS Forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BulletProof Security Forum</a>.

= I am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log. What do they mean? =

Your Security Log will log 400, 403 and 404 (requires copying the BPS 404 logging code to your Theme's 404.php Template) Errors. 
The Security Log logs 400 and 403 HTTP Response Status Codes by default. You can also log 404 HTTP Response Status Codes by opening this BPS 
404 Template file - /bulletproof-security/404.php and copying the logging code into your Theme's 404 Template file. When you open the BPS Pro 
404.php file you will see simple instructions on how to add the 404 logging code to your Theme's 404 Template file.

= HTTP Response Status Codes =

* 400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
* 403 Forbidden - The Server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
* 404 Not Found - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI / URL. No indication is given to whether the condition is temporary or permanent.

= What is the difference between BulletProof Security free and BulletProof Security Pro? =

= Is BulletProof Security Network / Multisite Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess 
code is written / created for your specific Network / Multisite site. BulletProof Modes should ONLY be Activated on the Primary site to automatically 
protect all sub sites. Sub sites are virtual. DO NOT Activate BulletProof Modes on sub sites. BPS allows only Super Admins to see the BPS menus 
in sub sites. BulletProof Security also works with Network / Multisite Domain Mapping.

= Is BulletProof Security BuddyPress Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security works with all BuddyPress site types.

= Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites? =

Yes, BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" websites.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If 
you are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Custom Permalinks need to be enabled when you access 
the BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one click is 
required to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. 
BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is 
designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every type 
of WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, 
Network / Multisite subdirectory websites and Network / Multisite subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master 
.htaccess files for your website when you click the AutoMagic buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your 
.htaccess using the built-in .htaccess File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess Master .htaccess files already contain .htaccess security code that protects 
your website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. Add any additional security filters or 
other .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The 
BulletProof Security Master .htaccess files contain help info and additional options within the .htaccess files themselves. htaccess files 
can do a lot of neat things besides just providing website security protection. As of version .46.9 you can now also add any custom code 
to the Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved to your WP DB permanently until you delete it. Please view the Read Me 
Help button in Custom Code for specific details.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes, BulletProof Security creates customized .htaccess website security files with AutoMagic. BulletProof Security also offers full manual 
control of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. 
The BPS Master .htaccess files have already been pre-made. When you click the AutoMagic buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with 
specific code for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added to your .htaccess files. You can 
add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the 
WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required.  BPS could also just be used 
simply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual editing control makes 
BulletProof Security a very versatile website security protection tool.

= Does BulletProof Security work with Git distributed version control system? =

Yes, BulletProof Security works with Git, but does require some additional set up steps. Please see this thread for the setup steps
 <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-bulletproof-security-bps-and-folder-locations?replies=15#post-2979555" title="BPS Plugin Language Translation Tutorial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Git distributed version control system setup steps</a>
