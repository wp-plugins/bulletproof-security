Fast one click switching between secure .htaccess security modes and maintenance mode from within the Dashboard. 

== Description ==

Protects your website from ALL XSS & SQL Injection hacking attempts. Base64_encode code injection blocked. BPS protects wp-config.php and php.ini files with .htaccess protection. One-click .htaccess security file activation. One-click website under maintenance mode activation (HTTP 503). Hide your WordPress version - WP Generator META tag removed, Check and ensure WP DB errors are off, Check WordPress file and folder permissions, Extensive system info (PHP, MySQL, OS, Memory Usage, IP, Max file size info, etc.). Security Status checking.

The BulletProof Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and convenient one click method for you to
switch between different levels of .htaccess website security and .htaccess maintenance modes from within
your WordPress Dashboard. The BulletProof Security WordPress plugin is a one click solution that simply copies,
renames and moves the provided .htaccess master files in the BulletProof Security plugin folder to either your root
folder or your /wp-admin folder or both from within your WordPress Dashboard.

There is no need to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to switch between
BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode(503 Website Under Maintenance), WordPress Default .htaccess Mode and
BulletProof Security .htaccess Mode. In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from
ALL XSS and SQL Injection hacking attacks. The maintenance .htaccess file allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin is a secure radio button form with options
that you select for what level of .htaccess security you want for your root
and /wp-admin folders. You can switch between (enable) all available modes
- default .htacces security, bulletproof .htaccess security and maintenance modes
in less than 5 seconds - ALL from within your WordPress Dashboard - No need to
access your site via FTP or your web host Control Panel to do anything more. 

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins? =

Not as this time. Bug fixes completed for: Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu, ComicPress, 
Simple Facebook Connect and W3 Total Cache. At this time AITpro.com has not been 
notified of any other plugin conflicts. If you know of a plugin that conflicts with 
BulletProof Security please notify AITpro.com.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof .htaccess files? =

Yes.  Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain
 .htaccess code that protects your website against ALL XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and SQL Injection
hacking attacks. Add your own additional .htaccess code to the master .htaccess
files to make them even more BulletProof to hackers.

= Does the BulletProof Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

No. The .htaccess files have already been created for you so you can just add more code
to them or create completely new .htaccess master files if you want and just use BulletProof
Security to manage the files for you. BulletProof Security is designed to handle copying,
renaming and moving of the master .htaccess files. File writing will be included in later
versions of BulletProof Security.
