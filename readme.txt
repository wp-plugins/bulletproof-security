Fast one click website security protection. Protects your website from ALL XSS and SQL Injection hacking attempts. 

== Description ==

Website Security Protection: Protects your website from ALL XSS & SQL Injection hacking attempts. Base64_encode code injection blocked. One-click .htaccess security file protection. Protects wp-config.php, php.ini, php5.ini, install.php and readme.html with .htaccess security protection. One-click website under maintenance (HTTP 503). WP META Generator tag removed, WP version hidden, ensure WordPress DB errors are off, file and folder permissions check, system info display (PHP, MySQL, OS, Memory Usage, IP, Max file sizes, etc.). File editing, file uploading and file downloading from within the WP Dashboard.

The BulletProof Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and convenient one click method for you to
activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess website under maintenance modes from within
your WordPress Dashboard. The BulletProof Security WordPress plugin is a one click solution that simply copies,
renames and moves the provided .htaccess master files in the BulletProof Security plugin folder to either your root
folder or your /wp-admin folder or both from within your WordPress Dashboard.

There is no need to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to switch between
BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode(503 Website Under Maintenance), WordPress Default .htaccess Mode and
BulletProof Security .htaccess Mode. In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from
ALL XSS and SQL Injection hacking attacks. The maintenance .htaccess file allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure. BPS provides the additional website
 security measures and protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin is a secure radio button form that allows you to 
add (activate) .htaccess files to your website without having to use FTP. BulletProof Security
 htaccess protection is one click website security. BPS has built-in Backup and Restore, a File Editor, 
 a File Uploader and a File Downloader to make managing the BPS files and your website security fast and simple. 

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page for new fixes that are not
yet included in the most current version of BPS.

- Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already?

Yes and No. BPS is designed to work automatically for the most common wordpress installation, 
which is wordpress installed in the root website folder. If you have wordpress installed in a 
subfolder then all you need to do is update your WordPress Custom Permalinks and that .htaccess
 code will be written to the active root BPS .htaccess file. There are also a couple of one time setups 
 that only need to be done once when first installing BulletProof Security. BPS Automagic Mode 
 is coming in the future, but for now a few one time setups are required.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain
 .htaccess code that protects your website against ALL XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and SQL Injection
hacking attacks. Add your own additional .htaccess code to the Master .htaccess
files to make them even more BulletProof to hackers.

= Does the BulletProof Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

No. The .htaccess files have already been created for you. You can add additional code
to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess 
master files from within the WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor 
- no FTP required. BPS could also just be used simply as an online .htaccess file manager. 
The current version of BulletProof Security is primarily designed to perform file copying, 
renaming and moving of the master .htaccess files and of course making your website 
BulletProof to hackers. BPS does have file writing capability, but the file writing is 
designed to be real time file editing that the website owner has complete control over 
instead of an "auto-writing" approach. Automatic or "AutoMagic" mode with complete 
automated file writing will be available in later versions of BulletProof Security.
